## Section 2. Planning and configuring a cloud solution

### 2.1 Planning and estimating Google Cloud product use using the Pricing Calculator
https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/
[Google Cloud Platform on a shoestring budget (Google I/O '18)](https://youtu.be/N2OG1w6bGFo)

### 2.2 Planning and configuring compute resources. Considerations include:

  - (a) Selecting appropriate compute choices for a given workload (e.g., Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Run, Cloud Functions) </br>
[Deciding between Compute Engine, Container Engine, App Engine and more (Google Cloud Next '17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0dN8Hkh5H8)
```Compute Engine``` - It's VM. So you have full control to do whatever you need to do to connect things together.
It's also a really good fit for existing systems.
```Kubernetes Engine``` - Container Engine is a system of containers working together to solve your problems.
```App Engine``` - App Engine is focused on making your web code run extremely well. It's optimized for that. And it's code first kind of thinking.

  - (b) Using preemptible VMs and custom machine types as appropriate </br>
```
# CREATE INSTANCE WITH 4 vCPUs and 5 GB MEMORY
gcloud compute instances create my-vm --custom-cpu 4 --custom-memory 5

https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-instances-are-managed
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/deploying-apps
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/app/services/set-traffic
    - ```Scaling``` - The type you assign to a service determines the whether its instances are resident or dynamic:
      - ```Manual scaling``` - A service with manual scaling use resident instances that continuously run the specified number of instances irrespective of the load level. This allows tasks such as comple initializations and applications that rely on the state of the memory over time.
      - ```Automatic scaling``` - Auto scaling services use dynamic instances that get created based on request rate, response latencies, and other application metrics. However, if you specify a number of minimum idle instances, that specified number of instances run as resident instances while any additional instances are dynamic.
      - ```Basic Scaling``` - A service with basic scaling use dynamic instances. Each instance is created when the application receives a request. The instance will be turned down when the app becomes idle. Basic scaling is ideal for work that is intermittent or driven by user activity.
    - ```Versions``` - The recommended approach is to remove the version element from your app.yaml file and instead, use a command-line flag to specify your version ID:
```
gcloud app deploy -v [YOUR_VERSION_ID]
appcfg.py update -V [YOUR_VERSION_ID]
```

  - (b) Deploying an application that receives Google Cloud events (e.g., Pub/Sub events, Cloud Storage object change notification events) </br>

</br>
A source snapshot used to create the disks. It is safe to delete a snapshot after a disk has been created from the snapshot. In such cases, the disks will no longer reference the deleted snapshot. To get a list of snapshots in your current project, run gcloud compute snapshots list. A snapshot from an existing disk can be created using the gcloud compute disks snapshot command. This flag is mutually exclusive with --image.
When using this option, the size of the disks must be at least as large as the snapshot size. Use --size to adjust the size of the disks.

### 4.5 Managing networking resources. Tasks include:

  - (a) Adding a subnet to an existing VPC </br>
https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-vpc
</br>
Adding a new subnet to an existing VPC network
You can add a subnet to a region of an existing VPC network. The primary IP range of this new subnet cannot overlap the IP range of existing subnets in the current network, in peered VPC networks, or in on-premises networks connected via VPN or Interconnect.

You can optionally assign a secondary IP range to the subnet for use with Alias IP. The secondary IP range also cannot overlap the IP ranges of existing connected subnets.</br>
```
gcloud compute networks subnets create [SUBNET_NAME] \
--network [NETWORK] \
--range [IP_RANGE] \
[--secondary-range [RANGE_NAME]=[2ND_IP_RANGE]
```
  - (b) Expanding a subnet to have more IP addresses </br>
You can expand the IP range of a subnet. You cannot shrink it.
Restrictions:
    - The new subnet must not overlap with other subnets in the same VPC network in any region.
    - The new subnet must stay inside the RFC 1918 address spaces.
    - The new network range must be larger than the original, which means the prefix length value must be a smaller number.
    - Auto mode subnets start with a /20 IP range. They can be expanded to a /16, but no larger.
```
gcloud compute networks subnets expand-ip-range [SUBNET_NAME] \
--region [REGION] \
--prefix-length [PREFIX_LENGTH]
```
  - (c) Reserving static external or internal IP addresses </br>
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ip-addresses/reserve-static-external-ip-address
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ip-addresses/reserve-static-internal-ip-address
  - (d) Working with CloudDNS, CloudNAT, Load Balancers and firewall rules </br>

### 5.1 Managing Identity and Access Management (IAM). Tasks include:

  - (a) Viewing IAM policies </br>
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/projects/get-iam-policy
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/organizations/get-iam-policy

https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/organizations/add-iam-policy-binding

  - (c) Managing the various role types and defining custom IAM roles (e.g., primitive, predefined and custom) </br>
https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles

https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/iam/roles/create
https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/projects.roles

### 5.2 Managing service accounts. Tasks include:
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts
  - (a) Creating service accounts </br>

  - (b) Using service accounts in IAM policies with minimum permissions </br>
**Best practices:**
In general, Google recommends that each instance that needs to call a Google API should run as a service account with the minimum permissions necessary for that instance to do its job. In practice, this means you should configure service accounts for your instances with the following process:
Create a new service account rather than using the Compute Engine default service account.
Grant IAM roles to that service account for only the resources that it needs.
Configure the instance to run as that service account.
Grant the instance the [googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform](https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform) scope.
Avoid granting more access than necessary and regularly check your service account permissions to make sure they are up-to-date.

  - (c) Assigning service accounts to resources </br>
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances
  - (d) Managing IAM of a service account </br>

  - (e) Managing service account impersonation </br>

  - (e) Creating and managing short-lived service account credentials </br>

### 5.3 Viewing audit logs
Cloud Audit Logging returns two types of logs:
- ```Admin activity logs:``` Contains log entries for operations that modify the configuration or metadata of a Compute Engine resource. Any API call that modifies a resource such as creation, deletion, updating, or modifying a resource using a custom verb fall into this category.
- ```Data access logs:``` Contains log entries for operations that perform read-only operations do not modify any data, such as get, list, and aggregated list methods. Unlike audit logs for other services, Compute Engine only has ADMIN_READ data access logs and do not generally offer DATA_READ and DATA_WRITE logs. This is because DATA_READ and DATA_WRITE logs are only used for services that store and manage user data such as Google Cloud Storage, Google Cloud Spanner, and Google Cloud SQL, which does not apply to Compute Engine. There is one exception to this rule: the instance.getSerialPortOutput does generate a DATA_READ log because the method reads data directly from the VM instance.</br>
