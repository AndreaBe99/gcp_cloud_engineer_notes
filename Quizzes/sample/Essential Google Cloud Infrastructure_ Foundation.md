  * [ ] Cloud Shell
  * [ ] Google Cloud Console
  * [x] Cloud Explorer

- What is the difference between the Google Cloud Console and Cloud Shell?

  * [ ] Cloud Shell is a locally installed tool, while the Cloud Console is a temporary virtual machine.
  * [x] Cloud Shell is a command-line tool, while the Cloud Console is a graphical user interface
  * [ ] The Cloud Console is a command-line tool, while Cloud Shell is a graphical user interface
  * [ ] There is no difference as these tools are 100% identical.

## Virtual Networks
- In Google Cloud, what is the minimum number of IP addresses that a VM instance needs?

  * [x] One: Only an internal IP address
  * [ ] Two: One internal and one external IP address
  * [ ] Three: One internal, one external and one alias IP address

- What are the three types of networks offered the Google Cloud?

  * [ ] Zonal, regional, and global
  * [ ] Gigabit network, 10 gigabit network, and 100 gigabit network
  * [x] Default network, auto network, and custom network.

  * [ ] Per-second billing that starts after a 1 minute minimum

- Which statement is true of persistent disks?

  * [ ] Persistent disks are always HDDs (magnetic spinning disks).
  * [ ] Persistent disks are physical hardware devices connected directly to VMs.
  * [x] Persistent disks are encrypted by default.
  * [ ] Once created, a persistent disk cannot be resized.
