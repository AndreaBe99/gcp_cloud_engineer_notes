# What is Cloud Computing

The delivery of a **shared pool** of **on-demand computing services** over the public internet, that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

Some examples of cloud services are:
- servers
- storage
- databases
- networking

The 5 characteristics of cloud computing are:
- **On-demand self-service**: the ability to provision computing capabilities as needed without human interaction
- **Broad network access**: capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms
- **Resource pooling**: the provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model
- **Rapid elasticity**: capabilities can be rapidly and elastically provisioned to scale rapidly outward and inward with demand
- **Measured service**: cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service
