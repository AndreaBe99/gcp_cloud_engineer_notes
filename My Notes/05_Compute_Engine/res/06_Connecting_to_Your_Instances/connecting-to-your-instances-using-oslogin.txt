##Only create if you do not have a default VPC network
Navigation menu > VPC Network
Create VPC Network
Name > default
Subnets > Subnet creation mode > Automatic
Firewall Rules > Select all firewall Rules
Click Create

Commandline use:
gcloud compute networks create default --project=PROJECT_NAME --subnet-mode=auto --mtu=1460 --bgp-routing-mode=regional

##Create Linux instance to connect to

Compute Engine > VM instances
Create instance
linux-instance
Region > us-east1
Zone > us-east1-b
Machine configuration > Machine type > e2-micro
Management, security, disks, networking, sole tenancy
Management > Metadata
For Key type in > enable-oslogin
For Value type in > TRUE
Click Done
Record the public ip (external) of your instance from the console

##Verify firewall rule has been created. If not, create it

VPC Network > Firewall > Create Firewall Rule
Name > public-access
Direction of traffic > ingress
Action on match > allow
Targets >  All instances in the network
Source filter > IP range
Source IP ranges > 0.0.0.0/0
Specified Protocols and ports
tcp > 22
Other protocols > icmp
Click Create.

Commandline use:
gcloud compute --project=PROJECT_NAME firewall-rules create default-allow-ssh --direction=INGRESS --priority=1000 --network=default --action=ALLOW --rules=tcp:22 --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0

##If you are not using a user with the Owner role, you will need to assign permissions to that user

IAM > Permissions > USER
(If your USER has owner permissions move on to reinitializing gcloud configuration)
Click on the pencil to edit permissions (Edit member)
Select a role > Filter > compute os
Choose Compute OS Login for non-root access or Compute OS Admin Login for root access
Click Save

##Reinitialize gcloud configuration

Open terminal with Google Cloud SDK installed
gcloud init > Re-initialize this configuration [default] with new settings
Choose the account you are currently using for this demo
Pick cloud project to use > PROJECT YOU LAUNCHED YOUR LINUX INSTANCE IN
Do you want to configure a default Compute Region and Zone? > n
gcloud config listÂ  > verify

##Create keypair and upload to your user account

For Mac and Linux:
ssh-keygen
Enter file in which to save the key > Hit enter
Enter passphrase > Use a passphrase of your choice (Please write this down otherwise you will not be able to use your key)
Enter passphrase again
cd .ssh
ls > verify your keys are created
gcloud compute os-login ssh-keys add --key-file .ssh/id_rsa.pub
Record your Username from the output


For Windows:
Open Google Cloud SDK shell
ssh-keygen
Enter file in which to save the key > Hit enter
Enter passphrase > Use a passphrase of your choice (Please write this down otherwise you will not be able to use your key)
Enter passphrase again
cd C:\Users\antoni/.ssh
dir > verify your keys are created
gcloud compute os-login ssh-keys add --key-file C:\Users\username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Record your Username from the output

##Connect to your instance using OSlogin

ssh -i .ssh/id_rsa username@publicip

##interact with the instance
run command uname -a
