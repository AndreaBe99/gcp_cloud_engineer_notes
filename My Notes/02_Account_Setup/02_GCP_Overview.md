# Google Cloud Platform Overview

In this section, there are 3 main topics of the YouTube video course.

## 01. Create Free Tier Account

Each Google Cloud account has 300$ of free credit to spend on Google Cloud resources, and it is valid for 90 days.

Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial) in incognito mode, and sign up for a free trial account.

Fill in the required information, and provide a credit card to verify your identity.

## 02. Securing Your Account

To log in to your Google Cloud account, you need to provide your email address and password. But it can be risky if someone gets hold of your password.

So, you can add an extra layer of security by enabling **two-factor authentication** (2FA) on your account. This way, even if someone knows your password, they won't be able to log in without the second factor.

Two-factor authentication requires a phone number to send a verification code. You can choose to receive the code via SMS or a phone call.
